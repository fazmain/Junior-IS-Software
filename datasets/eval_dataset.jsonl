{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> How’s your thesis coming along?\n<|turn|> Slow. I keep rewriting my intro.\n<|turn|> That’s normal. Want to swap drafts?\n<|turn|> Actually, yeah. Fresh eyes would help.\n<|turn|> I’ll send mine too. Be brutally honest.\n<|turn|> Deal. Critique incoming."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> What’s the reading for tomorrow’s seminar?\n<|turn|> Chapter 6 from the Foucault book.\n<|turn|> Again? That’s dense.\n<|turn|> I know. Took me an hour to finish 5 pages.\n<|turn|> Want to review it together later?\n<|turn|> Please. I need help decoding it."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> Did you submit the course feedback form?\n<|turn|> Not yet. Is it anonymous?\n<|turn|> Yeah, and it closes Friday.\n<|turn|> Good to know.

Just explain the situation.\n<|turn|> True. We have a deadline to meet.\n<|turn|> Exactly. Do what you need to."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> Do you understand the assignment prompt?\n<|turn|> Not really. The wording is vague.\n<|turn|> Same. Should we ask the professor?\n<|turn|> Maybe after class. He usually clarifies.\n<|turn|> Good idea. Don’t want to start in the wrong direction.\n<|turn|> Agreed. Let’s take notes when he explains."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I pulled an all-nighter writing that paper.\n<|turn|> You okay?\n<|turn|> Barely functioning. Caffeine is life.\n<|turn|> Been there. At least it’s submitted?\n<|turn|> Yeah, with one minute to spare.\n<|turn|> Heroic effort."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> The Wi-Fi in the library was terrible today.\n<|turn|> Tell me about it.

{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> What grade did you get on the midterm?\n<|turn|> B+. You?\n<|turn|> A-. I was shocked.\n<|turn|> You earned it! You studied hard.\n<|turn|> True. Still wish I did better on question 4.\n<|turn|> That one tripped me up too."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I just got the job!\n<|turn|> Are you serious? That’s amazing!\n<|turn|> I’m still shaking. I didn’t think I’d get it.\n<|turn|> You worked hard for it. You deserve this.\n<|turn|> Thank you. I needed to hear that.\n<|turn|> Let’s celebrate this weekend!"}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I’m feeling really overwhelmed.\n<|turn|> Want to talk about it?\n<|turn|> I have three deadlines and I just keep freezing up.\n<|turn|> That sounds rough.

{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I think I really messed up the interview.\n<|turn|> What happened?\n<|turn|> I blanked on one question and rambled.\n<|turn|> That happens. They look at the whole picture, not just one answer.\n<|turn|> I hope so. I just feel embarrassed.\n<|turn|> You’re being too hard on yourself."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> You ever feel like everyone’s ahead in life?\n<|turn|> Yeah. All the time.\n<|turn|> It’s like I’m stuck and watching everyone else move.\n<|turn|> You’re not alone in that. We’re all figuring it out.\n<|turn|> I just don’t want to fall behind.\n<|turn|> You’re doing fine. Your pace is valid."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> Can I be honest?\n<|turn|> Of course.\n<|turn|> I’m not okay. I’ve been pretending, but I’m really not.\n<|turn|> Thank you for telling me. You don’t have to go through this alone.\n<|turn|> I didn’t know how to bring it up.\n<|turn|> I’m here, always."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I can’t stop smiling today.\n<|turn|> Love to hear that! What happened?\n<|turn|> Someone I admire complimented my work.\n<|turn|> That’s huge! You deserve the recognition.\n<|turn|> It meant so much coming from them.\n<|turn|> Frame that feeling and remember it on rough days."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I’m scared I’ll fail this class.\n<|turn|> You’ve been trying your best.\n<|turn|> But what if it’s not enough?\n<|turn|> Then we talk to the prof, maybe get a tutor.\n<|turn|> I hate feeling like this.\n<|turn|> We’ll figure it out together."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I’m really proud of myself today.\n<|turn|> Tell me more!\n<|turn|> I finally gave a presentation without freaking out.\n<|turn|> That’s a huge win! How did it go?\n<|turn|> Smooth! I actually enjoyed it.\n<|turn|> Keep this version of you close."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I think they’re avoiding me.\n<|turn|> Did something happen?\n<|turn|> I don’t know. They just stopped replying.\n<|turn|> That sucks. I’d be overthinking too.\n<|turn|> Should I reach out or give space?\n<|turn|> Maybe one message. Then let it be."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I’m so done with everything.\n<|turn|> Want to rage text or break plates?\n<|turn|> Both sound amazing right now.\n<|turn|> Let’s go scream into the void.\n<|turn|> I appreciate the chaos energy.\n<|turn|> Always here for healthy-ish coping."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I cried in the bathroom today.\n<|turn|> Oh no... what happened?\n<|turn|> Just everything piling up. Felt too much.\n<|turn|> I’m so sorry. Want to talk about it?\n<|turn|> Not really, just wanted someone to know.\n<|turn|> I’m always here. No pressure, just presence."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> That awkward moment when you wave at someone who wasn’t waving at you.\n<|turn|> Oh no, secondhand embarrassment already!\n<|turn|> I wanted to disappear.\n<|turn|> Happens to the best of us.\n<|turn|> And the worst part—they saw everything.\n<|turn|> Just call it character building."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I’ve been laughing at this meme for 10 minutes.\n<|turn|> Send it. I need serotonin.\n<|turn|> Incoming chaos.\n<|turn|> Oh my god this is gold.\n<|turn|> Right? I needed that today.\n<|turn|> Mood lifted. Mission complete."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I feel so stuck in life.\n<|turn|> Want to unpack that?\n<|turn|> Everything feels... gray. Directionless.\n<|turn|> That’s tough. You don’t have to fix it alone.\n<|turn|> I guess I’m just tired.\n<|turn|> Let’s rest, not quit."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I miss how things used to be.\n<|turn|> Me too.\n<|turn|> Everything feels different now.\n<|turn|> Some of it’s growth, some of it’s loss.\n<|turn|> I wish I could go back, just for a day.\n<|turn|> We can’t go back, but we can carry the good forward."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I just found my old journal.\n<|turn|> Oh no... or oh yes?\n<|turn|> Both. It’s cringy but oddly sweet.\n<|turn|> Past you had feelings!\n<|turn|> So many. So dramatic.\n<|turn|> That’s the charm of it."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I finally cooked something that didn’t taste terrible.\n<|turn|> Chef in the making!\n<|turn|> It was just pasta... but it slapped.\n<|turn|> Victory is victory. Be proud.\n<|turn|> I plated it like I was on MasterChef.\n<|turn|> As you should."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> Why do I always compare myself to others?\n<|turn|> It’s human. But it’s not the whole truth.\n<|turn|> I just feel like I’m behind.\n<|turn|> You’re running a different race.\n<|turn|> That’s hard to remember sometimes.\n<|turn|> I’ll remind you every time you forget."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I think I offended them.\n<|turn|> What did you say?\n<|turn|> It was meant as a joke but landed badly.\n<|turn|> Happens. Maybe check in and apologize.\n<|turn|> Yeah, I don’t want to leave it weird.\n<|turn|> Owning it goes a long way."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I feel like I’m doing everything wrong.\n<|turn|> You’re not. You’re just overwhelmed.\n<|turn|> Nothing I do feels right lately.\n<|turn|> You’re trying. That matters.\n<|turn|> I just want to feel okay again.\n<|turn|> You will. Step by step."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> My sibling finally texted me back.\n<|turn|> After how long?\n<|turn|> Two months.\n<|turn|> Whoa. How did it feel?\n<|turn|> Weird. Good. Complicated.\n<|turn|> That makes sense. Want to talk it through?"}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I got into my dream school!\n<|turn|> WHAT?! THAT’S AMAZING!\n<|turn|> I cried when I saw the email.\n<|turn|> You earned this. All the late nights paid off.\n<|turn|> I still can’t believe it.\n<|turn|> Believe it. You're going places."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I feel invisible sometimes.\n<|turn|> That’s a painful feeling.\n<|turn|> Like I’m talking and no one hears me.\n<|turn|> I hear you. And I see you.\n<|turn|> Thank you. That means a lot.\n<|turn|> You matter. Always."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I saw your art post. It’s beautiful.\n<|turn|> Really? I wasn’t sure about it.\n<|turn|> Don’t doubt it. It moved me.\n<|turn|> Wow. That’s so encouraging.\n<|turn|> Keep creating. Your work deserves to be seen.\n<|turn|> Thank you. I needed that."}
{"text": "<|startofchat|>\n<|turn|> I just feel really lonely lately.\n<|turn|> I’m really sorry. Want to talk about it?\n<|turn|> I don’t know. It just lingers.\n<|turn|> You don’t have to carry it alone.\n<|turn|> I appreciate you checking in.\n<|turn|> Always. I’m just one message away."}
